            <h2>Physical Health</h2>
            <p>
                Elevate your physical well-being with a balanced approach to nutrition, regular exercise,
                and adequate sleep. Achieving and maintaining good physical health is essential for a

        <section id="nutrition">
            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Proper nutrition is the cornerstone of physical health. A well-balanced diet provides
                essential nutrients to support your body's functions. Include a variety of fruits,
                vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pay attention to portion sizes, and try to limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and
                excessive amounts of saturated and trans fats. Stay hydrated by drinking an adequate
                amount of water throughout the day.
            </p>

        <section id="exercise">
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining a healthy body. Choose activities
                that you enjoy, whether it's walking, jogging, swimming, or engaging in team sports. Aim
                for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incorporate strength training exercises at least two days a week to build and maintain
                muscle mass. Don't forget to warm up before exercise and cool down afterward to prevent
                injuries.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="sleep">
            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>
                Quality sleep is essential for overall well-being. Create a relaxing bedtime routine,
                maintain a consistent sleep schedule, and ensure your sleep environment is comfortable.
                Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lack of sleep can negatively impact your physical health, affecting metabolism, immune
                function, and overall energy levels. Prioritize getting enough restful sleep each night.

        <section id="stress-management">
            <h3>Stress Management</h3>
            <p>
                Chronic stress can take a toll on your physical health. Explore stress management
                techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga. These practices can help
                reduce stress hormones and promote overall well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Identify sources of stress in your life and work on effective coping strategies. Whether
                it's through hobbies, spending time in nature, or connecting with loved ones, finding
